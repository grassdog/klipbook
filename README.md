# Klipbook

Klipbook creates a nice html summary of the clippings you've created on your Kindle.

## How does it work?

Copy your clippings file (called "My Clippings.txt" on a 3rd generation Kindle) from your Kindle device to your local drive via USB.

**List the books in your clippings file:**

    $ klipbook list "My Clippings.txt"

    The list of books in your clippings file:
    [1] The Big Sleep by Raymond Chandler
    [2] How to jump out of a plane without a parachute and survive by Rip Rockjaw

**Print a html summary for the book of your choice:**

Choose the number of the book you are interested in and print a html summary with the `summarise` command:

    $ klipbook summarise "My Clippings.txt" 1 big-sleep-clippings.html

Keep the nicely formatted html version of your clippings for your own reference.

Note that you can add page numbers to the generated file by adding the `-p` option e.g. 

    $ klipbook summarise "My Clippings.txt" 1 big-sleep-clippings.html -p

## Installation

Klipbook is a Ruby gem. To install simply run:

    gem install klipbook

## Why not just see your clippings on the Amazon site?

Currently [the Amazon highlights site](https://kindle.amazon.com/your_highlights) only shows clippings for books you've purchased on Amazon.

## Supported Devices

Klipbook has been tested on clippings files from 3rd generation Kindles and the Kindle Touch.

## Tested platforms

Klipbook has been tested on Mac OSX Lion and Ubuntu using MRI 1.9.3. 

## Contributing to Klipbook

## TODO

Rework parsing code to pull out a file entry. Then have file container parse those and collapse
them into highlights.

Can have site scraper do the same.

Work out what the end state looks like and clean up code to move towards that.

**Work from the outside (i.e. outputter) in**

### Possible commands

klipbook fromfile [filename] --force

klipbook fromfile --list [filename]

klipbook fromfile --booknum=2 [filename]

klipbook fromsite --user=blah --pass=foo

klipbook fromsite --booknum=3

credit kindle-highlights

Explain when you'd want to use the clippings file and when you'd want to use the
site.
